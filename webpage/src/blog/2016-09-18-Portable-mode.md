# Portable mode

<v-subheader class="blog">Date: 2016-09-18</v-subheader>

There now is a **portable mode** for **QOwnNotes**, for example to carry around QOwnNotes on an **USB stick**.

In portable mode

- the internal sqlite **database** and the **settings** will be stored inside a ***Data* folder** at the binary's location
- the settings will be stored in an **ini file**
- the **note folders** will be automatically stored relative to the ***Data* folder** so that the correct note folders will be loaded regardless where your QOwnNotes installation is currently located

It will be activated if you run QOwnNotes with the **parameter *--portable***.

On **Windows** there is a ***QOwnNotesPortable.bat*** in your release path to start QOwnNotes in **portable mode**.

Note: QOwnNotesPortable.exe was dropped because of anti virus false positives.
